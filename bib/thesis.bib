	abstract = {Performance analysts proﬁle their programs to ﬁnd methods that are worth optimizing: the “hot” methods. This paper shows that four commonly-used Java proﬁlers (xprof , hprof , jproﬁle, and yourkit) often disagree on the identity of the hot methods. If two proﬁlers disagree, at least one must be incorrect. Thus, there is a good chance that a proﬁler will mislead a performance analyst into wasting time optimizing a cold method with little or no performance improvement.},
