The thesis thorougly explained the ideas behind sampling profiling and described the problems that could affect such profiling method. It then dissects the internals of Honest Profiler and explains why it is a viable choice \supervisor{and in which use-cases it outshines the others -- sampling bias etc} as profiler compared to \supervisor{other} existing profiling solutions.\supervisor{First sentence in past, second in present. Also, style question, in the thesis or thesis?} The performance of Honest Profiler's information acquiring logic was measured. Based on the performance measurments, it was apparent that it is possible \supervisor{there was no fundamental reason why it was not possible?} to increase the amount of information that can be extracted from the observable application by Honest Profiler.

The main result of this thesis are three solutions which increase the profiling information output wihtout causing noticeable performance overhead. The solution's performance and extracted information amount was tested on a benchmark test to verify the results. One of the provided solutions proved to produce reliable results with increased information output and negligible performance overhead. Although two of the provided solutions introduce new problems, ideas for improvement are presented in the future research section \ref{sec:future-research} \supervisor{Discussed in Slack. I think currently, the two other solutions are undersold.}.
