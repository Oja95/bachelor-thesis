This sections describes three different approaches for increasing the sampling frequency for Honest Profiler. To verify the performance overhead of the solution and its accuracy, a benchmark test was executed on each solution.

\subsection{Benchmark}
Benchmark test reads 10000000 random integers from an input file and then performs quicksort on the copy of the obtained list 10 times. For each solution, the benchmark is executed 10 times. Benchmark test code is included in Appendix \ref{B:benchmark-test-code}. 

%\supervisor{frames of interest -- we should reference to definition we have given here imho. Forward reference to future research would be possible, but I would prefer to reference backwards.}
Baseline of the test using the default implementation of the Honest Profiler finished the test in 59.83 seconds on average. During profiling, 19025 samples were obtained on average from which 15130 (81\%) contained useful and informative frames. Profiling results are visualized on the Figure ~\ref{fig:baseline} on page ~\pageref{fig:baseline}.

\subsection{Optimization implementations}
%This thesis covers three methods to obtain more samples from the observed application than  the default implementation of the Honest Profiler. 
\TODO{rephrase and add citatiopn to appendics}
Following sections will describe their implementations more in-depth.

\subsubsection{Interval timer based on real time}
Existing implementation of Honest Profiler uses CPU time based interval timer from GNU time library. Alternative approach would be to use an interval timer which counts time in real time instead. The same interval timer from GNU time library can be configured in such way that it counts down in real time by initilizing it with \texttt{ITIMER\_REAL} flag. Upon timer expiration, a \texttt{SIGALRM} signal is sent to the process \cite{getitimer2}.

Using real time based timer means that its interval is not limited by the system's clock frequency as it would be for CPU time based timers. Due to this fact, the timer can even be configured to send the \texttt{SIGALRM} signal every 1 microsecond.

Although this approach obtains considerably larger amount of samples due to higher profiling frequency, it also introduces a potential bias that could affect the profiling results. It is possible that between two consecutive timer expiration signals, the application under observation has not received any processor time to perform its instructions. This would imply that the same sample in the exact same state is persisted multiple times. Similar issue occurs the other way around when the application's instructions are executed on multiple processor cores. 
\TODO{explain what the hell is going on + add cpu time explanation somewhere}
There is a clear distinction in cases in which 4 processor cores are fully utilized when executing the application's instructions and cases in which a single processor core is used. The former scenario would get roughly four times as much work done when compared to the latter scenario. However, the real time based timer will not take these workload differences into account because it measures time based on the real world clock.
\TODO{add table to conclusion}

Average benchmark's execution time using this method finished in 70.78 seconds and obtained up to 12.8 million samples during its execution from which only 73982 (0.58\%) contained frames of interest. Whereas the 15\% increase in execution times is acceptable for gaining significantly larger amount of samples, it is unknown why only 0.58\% of the gathered samples contained frames of interest. This phenomenom is also further covered in the future research Section ~\ref{sec:future-research}. Visualization of the profiling results utilizing this method is presented in Figure ~\ref{fig:walltime}.

\label{fig:walltime}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Increasing the kernel clock frequency}
\label{kernel-clock}
As CPU time based interval timer from GNU timer library is directly dependent on the kernel's internal timer frequency, one approach to gather more samples would be to build a custom kernel with increased kernel clock frequency. By default this frequency is set to 250 Hz \cite{torvalds_linux:_2018}. This value can be increased to achieve higher sampling frequency. 

This can be accomplished by creating a custom configuration in the \texttt{Kconfig.hz} with a desired frequency value and building the kernel using the created configuration. An easier way to obtain a kernel with higher kernel timer frequency would be to install a \texttt{linux-lowlatency} kernel package which has set the kernel timer frequency to 1000 Hz.

Using the 1000 Hz kernel increases the sampling frequency as the CPU time based interval timer from GNU time library can now send an interrupt signal every $\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001$ seconds. Experiments with such kernel has shown four times increase in the amount of samples gathered wihtout causing significant performance overhead to the application under observation.

Benchmark runs on such configuration had average execution time of 61.82 seconds during which 70525 samples were collected. 50937 of the samples (72\%) consisted of meaningful samples.
\TODO{find better word}
When comparing to the baseline bechmark results, this solution resulted in 336\% increase in useful samples with negligible performance overhead. Visualization from the benchmark's execution using such profiling configuration is shown on Figure ~\ref{fig:hz_increase}.

\includegraphics[scale=0.375]{hz_increase.png}
\caption{Visualization of the results from profiling with increased kernel timer frequency}
\label{fig:hz_increase}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{External utility for timekeeping}
\label{shared-mem}

This approach moves the time measurement logic to an external server process which uses UNIX operating system signals and shared memory to communicate with Honest Profiler and the profileable Java process. The solution is based on the fact that it is possible for a process to obtain the CPU time that the process has used without the limitations imposed by the kernel's internal timer frequency. The CPU time spent by a process can be obtained by calling the \texttt{clock\_\-gettime} function from the GNU time library. Essentially, the external utility serves as a CPU time based timer which enables calling \texttt{Async\-Get\-Call\-Trace} method more often than default implementation.

The external server process starts by creating a UNIX domain socket and waits for a connection. Upon a connection from a Java process with Honest Profiler's native agent attached, it obtains its process identifier (\textit{PID}) for signal sending purposes. The server process then allocates a memory section which is shared with the profileable Java process. Server will then use two signals to request action from the Honest Profiler that is attached to the Java process:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{SIGALRM} - write the used CPU time used by the Java process to the shared memory
	\item \texttt{SIGPROF} - call the \texttt{Async\-Get\-Call\-Trace} method to obtain a sample from the thread handling the signal
\end{itemize}

Shared memory for interprocess communication is used due to its superior performance over other communication approaches such as file I/O (input/output) or UNIX domain sockets. 

Figure \ref{fig:shared_mem_arctitecture} on page \pageref{fig:shared_mem_arctitecture} summarizes the architecture of this implementation.

\end{figure}

%This can be credited to the fact that time measurement logic has been extracted from the Honest Profiler's logic which means that the Java process will have to execute fewer amount of instructions.

Testing shows that such modification for Honest Profiler runs the benchmark test in 63.85 seconds on average.  From running the benchmark test, a sample was obtained roughly after every 100 microseconds. 746868 samples were obtained during profiling and 38775 (5.2\%) of them were useful. This approach obtained 256\% more useful samples than the baseline benchmark.

Visualization of the profiling results from the benchmark run using this solution is presented in Figure \ref{fig:shared-mem-results} on page \pageref{fig:shared-mem-results}.

This approach is slighty less cumbersome to set up than installing a custom kernel as demonstrated in Section \ref{kernel-clock}. This solution has a different distribution of useful and non-useful samples compared to original implementation. Ideas describing this phenomenom are briefly covered in the Section \ref{sec:future-research}.
